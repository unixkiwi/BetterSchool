**Description of the Feature (required)**
A clear description of what the feature is all about and what it would add to the app.

**Implementation (optional)**
A clear description of how you would implement the feature into the app. Like a button there, with this label, that happens when it is pressed and maybe even libraries or code hints on how you would implement it code wise (just if you have the knowledge).

Here you can add screenshots, prototypes, designs and additional context to the feature request.
